The Evolving, loosely-specified, seminal list of things I plan to make, am making, or will never make because they're ridiculous.

In no order.

## Doors + Bash + Suicide-OS (Python/Shell/C?)
It's like [Doors](https://github.com/diemastermonkey/doors), except instead of navigating a procgen map, you're navigating your system directories, files, processes, etc - and the environments, NPCs, items, and events are procgen'd from the properties of those things. 

It should look and act like just using Linux, except fantasy version. Maybe hacker themed. 

Also some Suicide-OS in there too, so that typos are fatal. 

## CTF Scene Zine (PDF)
A simple digital zine devoted *only* to the CTF scene itself, at a meta level. Less about the writeups and more about the movers and shakers, competition results, events, trends in the scene, and gossip. Maybe a few writeups. And anonymous letters. 

Keep it short, obscure, and snarky.

## Space Pirate Radio (Android/JS prototype)
Actually a variation of my secret "Entroscope" app for Android. Using the same engine, but the navigational data used are the sky coordinates pointed *at* by the player (as opposed to their geolocation). Users will 'tune in' to broadcasts 'coming from' specific areas of the sky, which will rotate in and out of range as the earth rotates and their view of the stars changes. 

In other words, it's a radio for tuning-into transmissions from space. 

The transmissions will be a mix of procgen'd alien 'language', 'music', advertisements - everything you expect from a radio. And of course approprately strange static between bands. Some tunings can result in just odd or even pleasing 'white/brown/pink noise' effects.

Radio shows should also follow procgen'd schedules, like the NPCs in 'Entroscope'.

## Tubehose (Javascript/YouTube API)
I've always wanted to know "what's coming-in to YouTube right now, this moment?" and to see that in real-time: As if the world was pouring out of YouTube's firehose. This is actually pretty easily accomplished with the "YouTube Embedded Player" API, if a bit inelegantly. That actually might be the right approach. 

Or go overboard and write an XScreensaver plugin that does it fancier.

## Hunt (Android)
Yet another ProcGen gadget I've always wanted to make: You're hunting invisible phantoms/agents/etc with your phone. Track them down 'metal detector' style, combat them "in the electromagnetic realm", locate and collect treasure and items, etc. Upgrade your 'detector' (your phone) with buffs to increase scanning range/accuracy/resilience/etc. Could almost just be a re-skinning of Entroscope.

## Flapper Check (Google Chrome Extension)
Perform basic heuristics on a commentor or poster on YouTube, etc, by hovering over them or equivalent. By scoring against common spammer/bot/misinformation attributes (new accounts, fake content, repeated posts, created/managed as a herd/etc) and cross-referencing other sources, arrive at a likelyhood that the source is disingenious/misinformation/fake/automated. 

This really shouldn't be that difficult; Perform some research on the kinds of YouTube commenters that make MAGA statements and you'll see the common elements. Many bot herd accounts are registered years ago, but on the same day. A very thorough analysis of these traits and their scoring will be the trick to making this valuable. 

The name is a reference to Gulliver's Travels.

## unScript 2.0 (Javascript, Processing, or C?)
This is my weird scripting language that acts kinda like assembler, from PalmOS. Yes...PalmOS. It centered on very small, simple scripts with a minimal command set that spawned objects as independent, self-managing threads, with minimal intercommunication capabilities through a 'global whiteboard' approach. Intended for visual animations (such as moving sprite animations).

It was cool and I want to reincarnate it as a Javascript library or something else.
