The Evolving, loosely-specified, seminal list of things I plan to make, am making, or will never make because they're ridiculous.

In no order.

## Doors + Bash + Suicide-OS
It's like [Doors](https://github.com/diemastermonkey/doors), except instead of navigating a procgen map, you're navigating your system directories, files, processes, etc - and the environments, NPCs, items, and events are procgen'd from the properties of those things. 

It should look and act like just using Linux, except fantasy version. Maybe hacker themed. 

Also some Suicide-OS in there too, so that typos are fatal. 

## CTF Scene Zine
A simple digital zine devoted *only* to the CTF scene itself, at a meta level. Less about the writeups and more about the movers and shakers, competition results, events, trends in the scene, and gossip. Maybe a few writeups. And anonymous letters. 

Keep it short, obscure, and snarky.
